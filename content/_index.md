about:
    header: 'About'
    text: "Zach is a composer for film, TV, and games. Early on he began playing the guitar and found a passion in classic and progressive rock. He particularly enjoyed instrumental music and began writing instrumental rock and metal in his teenage years, finding inspiration from guitarists like John Petrucci, Joe Satriani, Andy Timmons, Paul Gilbert, and many others. During this time, Zach found that film scores touched him on a very deep emotional level, and soon began writing cinematic music after discovering the wonderful world of digital music production. He went on to get a bachelor's degree in Commercial Music from Brigham Young University. The music of Hans Zimmer, James Newton Howard, Harry Gregson-Williams, John Powell, Thomas Bergersen, and many others are significant influences in his own writing. Zach lives in Provo, Utah with his wife and son."
